Real-time Collaboration Platform

Problem Statement:
Develop a basic real-time collaboration platform where multiple
users can work on a shared document simultaneously. The platform
should display changes made by any user in real-time to all other
connected users. Implement basic features like user authentication,
document creation, editing, and saving.
Key Requirements:
• Frontend: Develop a responsive interface with real-time editing
capabilities.
• Backend: Implement user authentication, document
management, and real-time updates using Web Sockets or
similar technologies.
• Database: Store user information and documents.
• Bonus: Implement version control for the document, allowing
users to revert to previous versions.
